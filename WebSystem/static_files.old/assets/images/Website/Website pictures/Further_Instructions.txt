The picture for the catalouge items namely music festival and Stepping stones at a glance can be reused.
You only need to rescale those images. 
The Newsletter catalouge item should be removed and replaced with a school history catalouge item that uses the same 
background of the school.
You were right about the menu bar. the maroon is good.
I would like to please see the progress on the gallery page. I will send you more images through the day.
It seems the colour of the font of the sub menus in the navigation bar changes to blue instead of to the maroon chosen.
please fix this.
Finally, the background behind the catalouge item can stay while you will replace the backgrounds of the sections according to the 
naming of the images i have sent you.
